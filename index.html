            <p>In my professional endeavors, I collaborated with Kotlin, and Android Studio to contribute to the development of the AcuPick e-commerce picking app and the Safeway applications. My primary focus involved backend mobile development, specifically in creating precise delivery picking software tailored for the retail sector. I analyzed picking data to derive efficient strategies and proposed possibilities for enhancing service efficiency. A key aspect of my role centered on establishing two-way communication channels between customers and pickers, achieved through the integration of calling and texting software powered by Twilio. Additionally, I engaged in a comprehensive analysis of the potential benefits and challenges associated with integrating Twilio into Albertson's Systems, demonstrating a holistic approach to optimizing communication and service delivery in the retail domain.</p>

            <p>As an AI/ML Developer within a UC Davis-based organization, I actively contribute to a dynamic team focused on leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning for trend analysis and tool/model development accessible to the public for predictive purposes. My role involves integrating OpenCV, Python (utilizing Pandas, NumPy, and SciKit), and localized data to create robust solutions. Collaborating within a four-person development team, we are currently engaged in a project centered around analyzing two-minute reports from NBA games. The objective is to extract insights into trends related to referees, their impact on games, and instances of false calls. By building models from this analysis, our aim is to enhance the understanding of officiating dynamics and contribute to the improvement of future NBA games.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">RESUMESCORE.AI </h2>
            <p>I developed a comprehensive system that involves web scraping and vectorization of job postings from Indeed.com using BeautifulSoup and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The process includes matching these vectorized job descriptions with user-submitted resumes to suggest the highest specific compatibilities. To optimize efficiency, MongoDB is employed to expedite the submission process. In addition, I implemented a data-cleansing step for Indeed's data by removing stopwords and ensuring the integrity of the information. The frontend of the associated webpage is designed using React, NodeJS, and JavaScript, providing a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction with the system. This holistic approach ensures a robust and effective platform for connecting job seekers with relevant opportunities based on the intricacies of their resumes and job postings..</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">LIFE EXPECTANCY PREDICTION REGRESSION ANALYSIS AND MODEL</h2>
            <p>I employed R for an in-depth data analysis, utilizing key packages such as "MASS," "car," "leaps," and "psych." In the process, I conducted comprehensive residual analysis and variable transformations to optimize the performance of the statistical models. Addressing multicollinearity concerns, I utilized correlation matrices and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) assessments to identify and mitigate potential issues. For variable selection and model refinement, I employed stepwise regression, ensuring a streamlined and effective model. To validate the model's assumptions, I conducted various diagnostic checks, including assessments of residual histograms, QQ plots, and residuals versus fitted plots. These diagnostic checks confirmed the model's adherence to assumptions of linearity and homoscedasticity, enhancing the robustness and reliability of the analytical outcomes.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">CONTAGION CLASSIFICATION MODELING TOOL</h2>
            <p>In the analysis of a breast cancer dataset, I leveraged popular Python libraries such as Scikit-learn (SKlearn), NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas within the Jupyter environment. Employing these tools facilitated a comprehensive exploration and understanding of the dataset, enabling insightful data analysis. For a more advanced analysis, I turned to TensorFlow with the Keras API to implement deep learning techniques. Utilizing this powerful combination, I constructed and trained models aimed at achieving the most accurate prediction of malignant tumors. The integration of Scikit-learn for traditional machine learning tasks and TensorFlow for deep learning allowed for a holistic approach in maximizing the predictive capabilities of the models, contributing to a thorough understanding of the breast cancer data and enhancing the accuracy of tumor classifications.</p>
